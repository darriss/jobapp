Dear Hiring Team, 

It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my cover letter for the Communications Manager position. 
With a background in communications and social justice, I am excited for the opportunity to contribute 
to the RTW Foundation’s mission to improve health equity in New York City.

Throughout my career, I have worked exclusively in digital communications, gaining expertise in content 
creation, social media management, online marketing, and web development. For the past three years, I have 
used various media platforms to reach key stakeholders, led marketing campaigns that have raised over $2 
million in donations, and collaborated with over 50 law firms and nonprofit organizations to increase 
access to justice. In my current role at the New York City Bar Association’s Justice Center, I create, 
manage, and schedule all communications materials including quarterly newsletters, email blasts, social 
media posts, promotional videos, and press releases. Since joining, I’ve grown the Justice Center’s social 
media following by 20% and increased the open rate of blast emails by 15%. Through this work, I’ve connected
with city council members, service providers, and news outlets, learning how to nurture these relationships
over time. Collaborating with so many partners has exposed me to a variety of tasks and projects that have
broadened my perspective on effective online communication and marketing.

My experience aligns closely with the responsibilities outlined for the Communications Manager role at RTW 
Foundation. I have extensive experience in website management, including collaborating on video features 
and content ideas. Additionally, I have overseen the development and dissemination of annual reports, 
compiled and produced newsletters, and managed social media platforms to maximize exposure and engagement. 
My proficiency in writing press releases and my strong graphic design skills make me well-equipped to 
fulfill the requirements of this position

I am inspired by RTW Foundation’s commitment to improve the health of underserved communities, and would 
be grateful to leverage my communications expertise to amplify your impact. Thank you for taking the time 
to consider my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, 
Samantha Darris
